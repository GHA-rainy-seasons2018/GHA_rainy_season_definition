The package consists of three main scripts:

1)	Climatology:
	This script calculates the "first guess" for the estimation of the rainy season.
	It is referred as step 2 in Seregina et al. 2018. 
	There are two versions of the script:
		a) climatology_stations.ncl uses station data as input. 
		b) climatology_sat.ncl uses gridded datasets
	
	Both versions require a netcdf-file as input.
	
	The scripts perform following operations:
	-- read data
	-- estimate the month of lowest rainfall that marks the starting point of the hydrological year
	-- extracts hydrological years from rainfall time series
	-- determines the availability of data per hydrological year
	-- divides the year into pentads
	-- calculates pentad averages
	-- filtering
	-- estimates threshold values and its confidence intervals
	-- estimates climatological onset and cessation dates, including confidence intervals 
	
	
2)	Functions: functions.ncl
	This file contains all functions, that are used to estimate the rainy season onset and cessation:
	get_ref_mon				calculates the driest month in the climatology, which marks the beginning of the hydrological year
	year_avail				finds the start and end points for the year of interest
	get_pentads				divides the year into pentads
	avg_rain				calculates pentad averages
	get_filtering			Lanczos-filtering of pentad averages
	get_threshold			estimates the rainfall threshold by applying of the Alexandersson-test
	climatology_intervals	estimates the climatological rainy season onset/cessation pentads
	bootstrapping			estimates the confidence intervals of the rainfall threshold
	get_rainy_periods		determines periods above threshold
	get_overlap				calculate overlap between rainy period and rainy seasons
	get_onset				determines onset and cessation dates
